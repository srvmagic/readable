Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for test and code review purposes.

Prerequisites

Node and npm needs to be installed. You would also need an editor like Atom or Visual Studio to view the code
Installing

To check if Node is installed, open the Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell or a similar command line tool, and type node -v . This should print a version number, so you'll see something like this v0.10.35 . To see if NPM is installed, type npm -v in Terminal.

At the prompt: ⋅⋅1. $npm install and once successful run ⋅⋅2. $npm start – you should see the output below: Compiled successfully!

You can now view the readable app in the browser.

Local: http://localhost:3000/
